# Active Context: YouTube Summarizer

## Current Work Focus
- Verifying site functionality and Supabase integration.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of memory bank files.

## Next Steps
1. Check `.env.local` for Supabase configuration.
2. Examine `lib/supabase.ts` for client initialization.
3. Review authentication pages (`app/login/page.tsx`, `app/register/page.tsx`) for Supabase client usage.
4. Review API routes (`app/api/summarize/route.ts`, `app/api/delete-user/route.ts`) for Supabase interactions.
5. Run the application locally.
6. Perform manual tests for:
    - User registration.
    - User login/logout.
    - YouTube video summarization.
    - User deletion.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensure all Supabase environment variables are correctly set.
- Verify secure handling of user credentials and API keys.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project uses Next.js with API routes for backend functionality and Supabase for auth and database.
- Shadcn UI components are used for the frontend.
